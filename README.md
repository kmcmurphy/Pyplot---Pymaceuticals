In this notebook, the results of different drug regimen on populations of mice are analyzed and plotted. Based on the data, the following observations can be made:

* Initial data started with fairly consistent central tendencies across treatments for tumor size and a equal distribtuion of gender in mice was chosen. More analysis would be needed to determine the count of mice starting and ending each study and distribution of gender and weight across drug regmines to further assess test equality.

* In the four drug regmine examined, there is a strong correlation between the tumor volume and weight of the mouse. In one study of a single mouse on Capomulin, the tumor size decresed significantly over time. More data would need to be analyzed to understand if all mice reacted the same and if the size of the mouse is a factor in this outcome.

* For the size of the inital data provided, the data appears consistent, with there being only one outlier in the test (see bar plot for final tumor volume distribution).
